<b>Q:</b> What's this business with danger to the speakers?<br/>
<b>A:</b> This only applies in audio boost mode.  
 Overdriving small speakers can damage or destroy them.
 Keeping the boost to 30%-40% or lower should help, but it is not
 possible to test this app on all devices, and YOU ARE USING IT AT
 YOUR OWN RISK.  If you get screechy sound, lower the boost immediately.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> How do I listen to audio through the phone earpiece?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Run Earpiece and put a checkmark in the box beside "Audio through earpiece".<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> How do I launch Earpiece when I am in another application?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You can hold your SEARCH button. And if you recently ran Earpiece, you can hold your HOME button.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> What does the "proximity sensor" option do?<br/>
<b>A:</b> In earpiece-audio mode, it turns off the screen when you bring the phone close to your face, if your phone supports this functionality.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> How do I boost the volume?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Put a checkmark in the box to the left of "Volume boost", and then you can adjust the audio boost.  USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> When and why does the notification bar icon show up?.<br/>
<b>A:</b> It shows up when Earpiece needs to run a background service and needs to prevent being killed by the operating system. Currently this is needed to support the boost and proximity functions.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> Can I get source code for Earpiece or a license to include it in my own code?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Go to <b>code.google.com/p/earpiece</b> for the BSD-licensed source code.<br/><br/>
